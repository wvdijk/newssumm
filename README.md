NewsSumm
======

**NewsSumm** improves upon the just released News Summary button in Honk by allowing authors to easily create (unordered) list. Any line starting with a hyphen (-) or an asterisk (\*) is converted into a list item (\<li>...\</li>). The list is then wrapped in \<ul>...\</ul>.

This extension by default hijacks the existing News Summary button. If you prefer, you can have it leave the existing button as is and create a second one, by (un)commenting the appropriate lines of code.
